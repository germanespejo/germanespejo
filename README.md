👋 Howdy! I'm Germán Espejo-Saavedra, a newbie full-stack developer learning both front and back-end website development; more suited to the last one.
Currently I code using Javascript, HTML:5, CSS and I'm learning right now to use React.
I will learn other programming languages in the near future aswell!
Feel free to navigate the repositories and reach me if you need anything else.
Thank you! 👀�
